"""
Simple title-based clustering.

Input:  a list of article dicts, each at least with {"title": "...", "domain": "...", ...}
Output: a list of clusters, where each cluster is a list of the original article dicts.

Clustering is greedy: the first title in a cluster is the reference; a new title joins the
first cluster whose reference passes a similarity threshold; otherwise it starts a new cluster.
